In pitching Amazon.com's new line of Kindle Fire tablets last week, "Another Quote" company founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos portrayed them as an advance over Apple's popular iPads because of their cheaper price and the extensive content they could deliver, pointedly noting that the Kindle library has 180,000 exclusive books to download. 

"We want to make money when people use our devices, not when they buy our devices," Bezos said as he paced a brightly lit stage in jeans and blue sport jacket, subtly evoking the product launch style pioneered by Apple's late founder Steve Jobs. "If somebody buys one of our devices and puts it in a desk drawer and never uses it, we don't deserve to make any money."
